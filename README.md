# Multivariate Stock Price Prediction 💹 - LSTM
This project implements a time series multivariate analysis using RNN/LSTM for stock price predictions. A deep RNN model was created and trained on five years of historical Google stock price data to forecast the stock performance over a two-month period.

## Data Set 📥([Google Stock Price](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/history))
The dataset utilized comprises historical records for the stock price of [Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/history), captured on daily basis.

The dataset is sourced from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) and contains the following fields: *Opening price, Highest price, Lowest price, Closing price, Adjusted closing price, and Trading volume*.
