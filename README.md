## üì• Data Set ([Google Stock Price](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/history))

The dataset utilized comprises historical records for the stock price of [Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/history), captured on daily basis.

The dataset is sourced from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) and contains the following fields: _Opening price, Highest price, Lowest price, Closing price, Adjusted closing price, and Trading volume_.

The raw, interim, and preprocessed datasets can be located in their corresponding subfolders in the main data directory.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Project Workflow


### PHASE 0 - Dataset Collection
The dataset is sourced from Yahoo Finance:

1. The dataset comprises daily stock prices of GOOG, including:
   - Opening Price
   - Highest Price
   - Lowest Price
   - Closing Price
   - Adjusted Closing Price
   - Trading Volume

2. The dataset is organized into:
   - Raw Data: Directly downloaded from Yahoo Finance
   - Interim Data: Cleaned and formatted
   - Preprocessed Data: Ready for model training


### PHASE 1 - Explanatory Data Analysis

Implemented data exploration tasks:

1. Download and load the raw dataset file.
2. Explore dataset summary and statistics.
3. Perform initial data cleaning and type validation.
4. Analyze the stock performance data over time.
5. Select a specific period for analysis and filter data accordingly.
6. Store filtered dataset file to a local folder.

### PHASE 2 - Data Preprocessing

Implemented data processing and transformation tasks:

1. Load the filtered dataset file.
2. Validate and correct data types.
3. Select independent and target features.
4. Create training, validation, and testing splits.
5. Scale datasets to a [0,1] range using [MinMaxScaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html).
6. Store processed data files (train, validate, test) to a local folder.

### PHASE 3 - Model Training

Implemented training and prediction tasks:

1. Load preprocessed dataset files (train, validate, test).
2. Construct data structures by creating input sequences.
3. Build LSTM Model using [TenserFlow Sequential](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential):
   - First [Input](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/InputLayer) layer.
   - 4x [LSTM](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM) layers: units = 100
   - 4x [Dropout](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dropout) layers: rate = 0.2
   - Final [Dense](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense) layer with a single unit.
4. Compile LSTM model:
   - Optimizer: [Adam](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Adam)
   - Loss: [Mean Squared Error](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/losses/MeanSquaredError)
5. Train LSTM model:
   - Epochs: 200
   - Batch size: 64

### PHASE 4 - Model Inference and Predictions

Evaluate Model Performance:

1. Computed evaluation metrics on the test dataset:
   - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: 0.8055
   - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: 1.2090
   - **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: 2.27%
   - **MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error)**: 1.4381
   - **SMAPE (Symmetric MAPE)**: 2.27%
   - **R¬≤ Score**: 0.9991
2. Visualization of Predictions:
   - **Actual vs Predicted Stock Prices** : Line plot comparing true stock prices vs. predicted values.
   - **Residual Error Distribution** : Histogram or KDE plot of residual errors (actual - predicted).

### PHASE 5 - Visualization with TensorBoard
1. Logging Training and Validation Metrics:
   - Tracked loss and evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE, MASE, SMAPE, R¬≤ Score) during training.
   - Logged using TensorFlow's tf.summary API for visualization in TensorBoard.

### PHASE 6 - Deployment
1. Deployment using FastAPI
